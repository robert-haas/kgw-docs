    "- The workflow definition at the beginning means that the knowledge graphs of several projects should be converted to several output files of different formats. This requires that the original files are downloaded from the projects' respective web repositories and then converted step by step into the desired output formats.\n",
    "- Running the workflow auto-generates a directory structure in the user-defined working directory `a_workdir_for_kgw`. First there is a subdirectory for each project in its chosen version, so that no collisions can happen. Each directory of such a kind then has two further subdirectories to separate fetched from generated files:\n",
    "  - The `downloads` directory contains all files fetched from the project's web repository in unmodified form, shown in red here. The number and types of files varies between projects because there is no widely accepted standard for how to encode a knowledge graph.\n",
    "  - The `results` directory contains all files derived from the raw downloads, shown in green here.\n",
    "    - `kg.sqlite` is a file-based SQLite database, which serves as intermediate format that is used as common basis for all conversions and analyses supported by this package. For this reason, it has to be generated in every case before producing any other outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is possible to define a small workflow for a single project and output, or a large workflow for multiple projects, versions and output formats. Internally, the Python package [luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi) is used to build a dependency graph, which contains all tasks that need to be run in order to produce the desired output files. The local inputs and outputs of each task along the way are well defined, so the scheduler can automatically run them as early as possible and often in parallel. For example, all downloads are independent, so they don't need to wait for each other, but some downstream conversions require multiple input files, so they have to wait for a specific subset of downloads or other conversions to be finished. The overall process can be tracked through messages that are written whenever a task starts or is finished. If everything worked, the `run` function returns `True`. If some part failed, e.g. due to a failed web connection, the other parts are attempted to be finished as far as possible, but a `False` is returned to make clear that something is missing. The workflow can then be restarted and will not begin again from zero, but rather will only run tasks that have not produced their local outputs yet. Some work may be lost anyways, e.g. when a specific conversion was interrupted in the middle the progress is usually lost, but downloads will attempt to continue from partial files."
